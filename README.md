Javascript in Browser - Common Web APIs (Module 3 - Fundamentals)

I made a To Do List the stores the infromation in the user's browser using Local Storage API.

To Do List:
  * The Date is at the top of the list. Using new Date ()

  * Add item to the list at the bottom of the form. It will be stored in the browser, even if the browser is refreshed. It is stored using localStorage API, which stores the infromation in the user's browser.

  * Click Check-circle for the item that you have finished and the circle will get a green check mark but it will not disappear from the list

  * Remove a item from the list you will click on the trash can icon and then it will disappear from the list aswell as in Local Storage.
  
  * To refresh the whole list you will click the arrow-circle icon in the right top corner. Then all the iteams will disappear from Local Storage and you can make a new list.
