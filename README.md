Javascript in Browser - Common Web APIs (Module 3 - Fundamentals)

I made a To Do List the stores the infromation in the user's browser using Local Storage API.

To Do List:
  * The Date is at the top of the list.  new Date ()

  * Add a new item to the list at the bottom of the form. The item will be stored in the browser, even if the browser is refreshed. It is stored using localStorage API, which stores the infromation in the user's browser.

  * Click the circle icon for the item that you have finished and the circle will get a green check mark but the item will not disappear from the list

  * Removing the item from the list you can click on the trash can icon and then it will disappear from the list aswell as from Local Storage.
  
  * To refresh the whole list you can click the arrow-circle icon in the right top corner. Then all the iteams will disappear from Local Storage and you can make a new list.
